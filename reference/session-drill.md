#Countly Session Drill

Session Drill is an extension to popular [Countly Drill](https://count.ly/resources/reference/drill) which provides the same awesomeness for your session data. You don't need to do anything extra to take advantage of Session Drill.

Every view under analytics menu now has a Drill button as shown below which takes you to Drill view and applies the related filter for you.

For this particular case when you click the Drill button under Devices view, you will automatically be navigated to Drill with a BY filter on *Device*. You can continue to drill down this data by applying more filters.

Currently you can apply any combination of AND, OR, BY filters to below user properties;

- App Version
- Carrier
- Country
- City
- First Session
- Last Payment *(available only if [Revenue Analytics](https://count.ly/resources/reference/revenue-analytics) is active)*
- Last Session
- Platform
- Platform Version
- Resolution
- Session Count
- Total Session Duration

Here is another example that shows session data for our app versions 3.3 and 2.0 segmented by platform.
