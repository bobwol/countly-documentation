# Contributing to Countly

Many people want to dive into open source software, but do not know where to start. 
Most of the time they have the energy and enthusiasm, but do not have a clue about how to behave, 
whom to talk, what to read in order to begin with their contribution.

Countly is a good example of an open source project - it has a ticketing system, 
a searchable knowledgebase, nice developers to connect to, and most importantly, 
a global vision with a public roadmap. Therefore joining doesn't require high barriers and 
high profile. Even if you are just a Twitter user, documentation writer or just spotted an issue, 
Countly is one of the best projects to contribute to.

Let’s dive into what it needs and means to be a Countly contributor.

### Download & fork our source code

We use Git, a distributed version control system and Github, a service that gives 
open source developers several tools to keep their source code. All our code resides in GitHub servers, 
and Github provides wonderful ways to read, fork, examine and contribute code back to the project. 
One of the first things you should be doing is learning Git commands - 
this is really a good start towards being a part of Countly and other Git-supported open source projects.
Even our [documentation is on Github](https://github.com/osoner/countly-documentation/).

### Write reviews and documentation

All open source projects needs a lot of documentation and Countly is not an exception. 
You can either contact us directly for a review/doc, or start writing your own. 
You don’t have to be a linguistic expert - anything, from reviews to an in-depth installation 
guide anything would help.

### Follow Countly on Twitter & Facebook

We are always updating our latest status on Twitter and Facebook, and use these two social environments 
a lot. A quick and dirty way to ask a question to Countly developers is to contact them via Twitter.

### Write an SDK for your platform

Currently Countly is written for iOS, Android, Blackberry, Windows Phone and Mac OS X platforms. 
Contributors have provided SDKs for Titanium SDK and Unity 3D. Basically, if a device is connected 
to internet, you can get analytics data easily with a simple SDK. Examples include but not limited 
to Smart TVs, set top boxes, mobile apps using HTML5/Javascript, desktop 
operating systems, in-car entertainment systems, IP security cameras - anything that is able to 
send HTTP requests can be a part of your analytics.

Countly always needs more contributors, and you don’t have to be a developer guru to 
be a part of Countly. Join us in the adventure of building the best analytics platform!
