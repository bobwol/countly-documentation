#Useful links about MongoDB, Node.js and Countly libraries

Here's a quick list of MongoDB and Node.js related documents and HOWTOs. It'll help you administer your system securely and with ease.

Most of the links below are directly linked to MongoDB & Node.js official documentation, so if you need something more in depth, please refer to these two sites for more information.

## MongoDB installation and maintanence

* [Installing MongoDB on Ubuntu](http://www.mkyong.com/mongodb/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu/): Our script automatically handles this, but you may want to know how it works behind the curtains.
* [Starting and stopping Mongo](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Starting+and+Stopping+Mongo)
* [Troubleshooting MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Troubleshooting): A quick and lean document about what can be done when something bad occurs.

##Node.js links

Node.js is used at the backend of the whole Countly framework. In fact, 99% of Countly is written in Javascript, which is also the native language of Node.js.

* [Beginner's guide to Node.js](http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html): A nice, entry level document if you are interested in getting more about Node.js, the heart of Countly.
* [What Node.js is and isn't](http://www.slideshare.net/ggoodale/getting-started-with-mongodb-and-nodejs)
* [Node.js: A quick tour](http://www.slideshare.net/the_undefined/nodejs-a-quick-tour)

## Frameworks, modules & libraries

There are a few Node.js modules included in Countly you can have a look at:

* [GeoIP-lite](https://github.com/bluesmoon/node-geoip), which is used to convert IPs to country and city names.
* [Moment](http://momentjs.com), a lightweight javascript date library for parsing, manipulating, and formatting dates.
* [Mongoskin](https://github.com/kissjs/node-mongoskin), a wrapper of node-mongodb-native driver.
* [Time](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-time), a simple binding for C time API.

Apart from those above, there are several Javascript libraries bundled with Countly. This list is for reference purposes.
